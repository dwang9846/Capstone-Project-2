# Capstone-Project-2
Capstone Project #2

There are total 6 files attached here, but acutally should be 7. There is another file that is too big to be attached into Github.
I put in it google drive and put the link below.

Seven files:
1. Capston Project #2 Report
2. Capston Project #2 coding Step1. Loading Data
3. Capston Project #2 coding Step2. Data Cleaning
4. Capston Project #2 coding Step3. Data Exploration and Modeling
5. Capston Project #2 Presentation
6. Reduced size data file: data1
7. Reduced size data file: cap2_data2: upload in google drive. Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ec4NHxBirIebVWUHXCpWOKGXA78Bhwaj/view?usp=sharing

I split my coding into three steps since my dataset is too big to work with.
After each big cleaning steps I did to reduce the size of the dataset, I saved the smaller file to a new CSV.
The next step reads the reduced size dataset to experdize the running speed.

Step 1: Loading Data--Reduced size data: data1.csv is created, but too big to uploan in github. Saved on google drive. 
Step 2: Data Cleaning-Reduced size data: cap2_data2 is created and uploaded here
Step 3: Data Exploration and Modeling
